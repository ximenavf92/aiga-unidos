Dio *(Dee-oh)* is a Peruvian-born and Atlanta-based illustrator, graphic designer, and educator. Prior to starting her career in Design, she was a CPA. She soon realized this was not her true calling, and embarked on a new adventure graduating as a Designer from Portfolio Center. Currently Dio has her own design studio, teaches at Miami Ad School, is Treasurer of [AIGA Atlanta](https://atlanta.aiga.org/), and is one of the co-founders of AIGA Unidos. Dio believes as humans we are all searching for connection, and her goal is to connect creatives of all fields so they can collaborate and create stronger, united, and thriving communities. When Dio is not working or volunteering, you can find her spending time with her husband and her pups, baking pies, or tending to her herb and veggie garden.
