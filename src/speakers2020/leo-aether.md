The Andes, the backbone of the Americas, is the source of life and light for an entire continent – and this is the energy that flows through Leo Aether’s music.

Leo Aether fuses South American folk, trova, rock n’ roll and poetry. His musical journey began in the USA as the leader of Urbe Prima, a rock and psychedelia band. In recent years, Leo has toured through Central and South America as a solo artist under the stage name of Leo Aether.

Leo’s new album "El Sendero del Fuego" (The Path Of Fire) is an alternative rock record mixed and mastered by award-winning engineer and producer Bruce Hensal, with credits including The Eagles, Eric Clapton, Judas Priest, Stevie Wonder and Aerosmith and many others.
