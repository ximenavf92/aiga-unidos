Journalism Associate Professor Elio Leturia inhabits overlapping worlds. As a bilingual journalist, he constantly shifts between English and his native Spanish. As a visual journalist, he moves between written content and design elements to pair stories with the perfect images, layout, and typography. “Photography, illustration, writing, editing, designing are elements of my regular production,” he says. His design work has been recognized by the Society for News Design, the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, the American Institute of Graphic Arts, and the Associated Church Press. He is the Communications Director of the Chicago Chapter of the Fulbright Association. His documentary “Tita Turns 100" premiered at the Chicago Feminist Film Festival in 2016, winning the Lisagor Award in the Best Short Film Documentary category in 2017. His bilingual historical book “Aguijón 30 Years” was published in August 2019. He is also an ensemble member of Aguijón Theater Company of Chicago.
