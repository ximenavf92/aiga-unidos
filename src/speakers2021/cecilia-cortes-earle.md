Cecilia Cortes-Earle helps organizations integrate their brand and convey their mission. As a creative leader, she has created marketing and ad campaigns for impact-driven organizations such as the National Geographic Society. She‘s rather obsessed with visual systems as she believes integration provides a more powerful experience of a brand. Working in-house for global nonprofits has helped her develop a keen interest in education and the world. She builds trust with clients as they witness her processes as a key component in her practice.  Her work has been recognized in Print magazine, Graphic Design USA, American Design Awards, and AIGA featured portfolios among other institutions.
Cecilia is an alumna of the AIGA Business Perspectives for Design Leaders executive education program at Harvard Business School and a former board member with AIGA DC chapter. As a designer interested in education, she’s been a mentor with AIGA RISE and speaker in classrooms and conferences.
