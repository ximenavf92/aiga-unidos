Dr. Omar Sosa-Tzec studies design delight: how a design product captivates, surprises, amuses, wins over, and reassures the user through its appearance and use. His research is concerned with the semiotics, rhetoric, and aesthetics of this phenomenon. His practice centers on information design, and he is passionate about interfaces, symbols, diagrams, colors, typography, and flavors. Omar has taught a variety of design topics to both designers and non-designers from undergraduate and graduate programs in Mexico and the United States. He has developed courses about visual design for user experience, design methods and research, information architecture, human-computer interaction, and interaction design.
