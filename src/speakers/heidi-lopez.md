Heidi Lopez is a Latinx designer and Illustrator, and grad student at Pratt Institute. Being a daughter of immigrants, it is very important to her to create artwork that analyzes negative societal perspectives and try to offer new viewpoints. When she is not trying to conquer social injustice through art, she enjoys creating colorful illustrations, creating logos for brands or businesses and spending time with her familia.
