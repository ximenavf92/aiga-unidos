Gladys Jose is an illustrator and storyteller. She graduated from the University of Central Florida in 2012, where she earned a Bachelors in Fine Arts degree, specializing in graphic design. Gladys is the illustrator of FRESH PRINCESS (HarperCollins, 2019), THE ELEPHANTS HIDE AND SEEK HANDBOOK (Sourcebooks 2020) as well as a chapter book series for EPIC! Books. She has also worked with Scholastic Book Fairs, Tangerine Press (a Scholastic imprint), SunDance Graphics and many others.
Gladys lives in sunny state of Florida, with her husband and daughter. They spend most of their days trying to recall if they had carpet or tile underneath the mountains of toys and books. Time will tell… unless it gets worse. It doesn’t get worse… does it?
