Matias is a designer living in sin. He has stopped having fun with his Wacom and Adobe as he once did, and started a love affair with Python and Data Science. He has designed for about 15 years, and started as many, first in a small agency, then a larger one and then to a company as head designer. In 2015, He got his MFA in Visual Communications Design while researching about type, perception and political campaigns. While doing so, he also taught for the first time and changed his whole career path. Now he teaches and works in one of the best Design Schools in Chile and is studying a Master in Data Science.
