Born and raised in Mexico City, Bryony Gomez-Palacio is a graphic designer and writer now living in Bloomington, IN. She is co-founder of [UnderConsideration](https://underconsideration.com/)—a graphic design firm and publishing enterprise all rolled into one—where she manages the behind-the-scenes of the online network comprised of Brand New, FPO, Quipsologies and The Art of the Menu. Bryony has co-authored five books with her husband and partner, Armin Vit—their most popular titles being Graphic Design, Referenced and the self-published Flaunt. Most recently, they conceived and presented the Brand New Conference, the Brand New Awards, the FPO Awards, and the recently launched lecture series by The Austin Initiative for Graphic Awesomeness. Bryony enjoys conducting workshops and lecturing when not tending to her two young daughters and their crazy schedules.
