Yocelyn Riojas is a Mexican-American visual designer, illustrator, and artist born in Piedras Negras, Coahuila, and raised across the border in Eagle Pass, Texas. Growing up, she was influenced by her parents, who grew up as migrant workers, now serving as attorneys, helping farm-workers, and asylum seekers. Passionate about empowering her community by creating a voice for people of color, she is using her graphic design work and illustrations to inspire and prompt a new generation of activists.
