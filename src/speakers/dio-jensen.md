Currently Dio has her own design studio, teaches at Miami Ad School, is Treasurer of [AIGA Atlanta](https://atlanta.aiga.org/), and is one of the co-founders tib AIGA Unidos. Dio believes as humans we are all searching for connection, and her goal is to connect creatives of all fields so they can collaborate and create stronger, united, and thriving communities. When Dio is not working or volunteering, you can find her spending time with her husband and her pups, baking pies, or tending to her herb and veggie garden.
