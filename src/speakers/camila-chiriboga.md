During her time there she won the Eyes on Talent Innovation Award, was the finalist in the BFA Academic Award for Social Innovation, and was selected as part of the CFDA Fashion Future Graduates. She won the AARP Award for fashion disruptors with her project veº, which led to a video that became the finalist for Webby Awards in the category of “Fashion and Beauty”.
